# Treasure Audit 
### The simple web spider with a desktop interface

Treasure Audit is a program that allows you to crawl websites and audit their pages for content. The use cases for this software are similar but different to the use cases for search engines, because search engines cache all of their pages. In other words, you can audit a website immediately - an exciting prospect for webmasters.

## Features
- Import a list of websites to crawl from a .txt file
- Export a list of matched pages
- Add a virtually unlimited amount of matching criteria to filter for content
- View pages with an HTML text viewer or HTML renderer
- Highlight matches within the HTML view
- Linux, Mac, and Windows compatibility

## Installation

In the future, I will offer builds of Treasure Audit from my website.
